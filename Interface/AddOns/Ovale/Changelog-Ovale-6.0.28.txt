Tagging as 6.0.28 release.


--------------------

Johnny C. Lam:
	- Update default scripts to SimulationCraft git master from 2014-12-02.
	- Add test script to compile the default script for each class/spec combo.
	- Add license information to WoWMock module.
	- WoWMock creates a sandbox environment in which to run addon code.
	- Complete the rename of WoWAPI to WoWMock.
	- Rename WoWAPI to WoWMock to more accurately reflect its intended usage.
	WoWMock will be a standalone environment providing mock-ups for various
	Blizzard API calls and provides a sandbox for executing code as from
	within the WoW client.
	- Mock-up enough of the Blizzard API to allow additional events for testing.
	The typical addon loading process fires the following events, in order:
	
	    ADDON_LOADED
	    SPELLS_CHANGED
	    PLAYER_LOGIN
	    PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD
	
	WoWAPI mocks up enough of the Blizzard API used by Ovale to allowing
	firing these events in a standalone Lua interpreter.
	- Don't create table.wipe and string.split if they don't exist.
	WoW provides "wipe" and "strsplit" as global symbols so use those in the
	code instead of adding new methods to the standard Lua libraries.  This
	keeps the namespaces cleaner.
	- Don't hook PLAYER_LOGIN in OnEnable() method.
	OnEnable() is called by AceAddon-3.0 as part of PLAYER_LOGIN, so by then
	it is already too late.
	- Don't register for PLAYER_ALIVE event.
	PLAYER_ALIVE used to be the signal that talent and quest information was
	loaded and ready, but as of 5.4 it no longer satisfies that role.
	- Minor optimization when unparsing AST nodes.
	- Fix actionId returned by a texture.
