Tagging as 6.0.27 release.


--------------------

Johnny C. Lam:
	- Update default scripts to SimulationCraft git master from 2014-11-29.
	- Add translation for SimulationCraft's "cancel_buff" action.
	- Extend Texture() to take a spell ID as well as a texture string.
	- Mage: workaround possible bug in SimulationCraft frost mage APL.
	Frost Bomb has a duration of 12 seconds but the APL is requesting that it
	be refreshed when fewer than 10 seconds are remaining.
	
	Noted in ticket 475 by @draak2883.
	- Shaman: Only suggest Ascendance if not in Ascendance.
	Ascendance does not go on cooldown until after the buff expires, so do not
	suggest Ascendance if already in Ascendance.
	- Shaman: Lava Burst has no cooldown during Elemental Ascendance.
	- Warlock: Improve Havoc suggestions for destruction.
	Only suggest Havoc when there are multiple targets and suggest casting
	Havoc on a secondary (other) target.
	
	Move Havoc to the short CD icon so the player can decide whether to
	interrupt the main attack to cast Havoc.
	- Rogue: Move Marked for Death to the short CD icon.
	It's off-GCD and has a one minute CD during boss fights, so move Marked
	for Death from the main attack the short CD icon.
	- Monk: Fix invalid stance names used to describe Jab.
	Fixes ticket 477 by @TuhMuffinMan.
	- Verify stance values are valid when parsing the script.
	- Properly flatten parameters into strings when "!" is used.
	The "!" was being attached to the wrong part of the string.  This is a
	parser bug and didn't affect any of the default scripts, but is fixed for
	correctness.
