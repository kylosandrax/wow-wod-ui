Tagging as 6.0.23 release.


--------------------

Johnny C. Lam:
	- Druid: Glyph of Savage Roar buffs the Rake used from Prowl.
	Implement this by having Prowl (or Incarnation) grant Savage Roar's 40%
	increased damage bonus unless Savage Roar is active.
	- Allow run-time checks in SpellDamageBuff() declarations.
	- Aura start and ending times may not always be printable numbers.
	- Rename "compiler.pl" to "lint.pl" to more accurately reflect its purpose.
	- Avoid creating a closure using string.gmatch() unless needed.
