Ovale Spell Priority 6.2.16
===========================

Changes from version 6.2.15:
----------------------------

-   Only suggest the legendary ring if it is equipped and usable.

-   Regenerate scripts to re-add suggesting on-use trinket actions.

-   Merge branch 'simulationcraft'.

    Add "use_item" actions to SimC APLs so that script code for on-use
    trinkets is properly generated.

-   Add "use_item" to APLs to properly generate code for on-use trinkets.

-   Suggest using the legendary ring separately from trinkets.

    Also fix a bug where non-spell actions were not emitted by the SplitByTag
    functions.

-   The engineering glove enhancement was removed ages ago.

-   Import latest release.sh from curseforge-packager project.

-   Update localized strings from CurseForge app from 2015-12-30.

-   Regenerate scripts based on SimulationCraft git master from 2015-12-17.

-   Avoid emitting "call_action_list" as a missing symbol.

    Filter out special actions from the list of actions that are regarded as
    requiring symbols.

-   Add trinket information for the Soul Capacitor.

-   Add item ID for the Empty Drinking Horn.

-   Translate SimC's "equipped.<item>" to allow checking for equipped items.

-   Translate SimC's "eclipse_dir.<name>" expressions for balance druids.

-   Translate SimC's "solar_max" for balance druids.

-   Teach OvaleSimulationCraft about "@" absolute value operator.

    Limit its translation to simple inequalities involving absolute values by
    converting to the appropriate union or intersection of one-sided
    inequalities. The latter are more suitable for translating into the
    equivalent Ovale timespan concept.

    This fixes the translation of "@" used in balance druid APLs involving
    "@eclipse_energy".

-   Druid: Move Cenarion Ward back to short CD icon for Guardian druids.

    Cenarion Ward should not be used on cooldown since it wastes a GCD that
    could be used to generate rage and is situational in providing a burst
    heal for the tank.

-   Merge branch 'simulationcraft'

    Pull in changes from SimulationCraft git master from 2015-12-17.

-   Import Tier18M profiles from SimulationCraft git master from 2015-12-17.
