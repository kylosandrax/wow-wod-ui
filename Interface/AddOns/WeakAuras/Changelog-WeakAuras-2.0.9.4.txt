--------------------

JTF195:
	- Add custom trigger funtion to dynamically change the texture property of displays.
Infus:
	- Fix spellname
Benjamin Staneck:
	- more indenting and trying to get localization to work
	- new enUS export
	- import base (enUS) locale from Wowace, too
	- indent change to trigger translations
	- Never lose an end, this time it's okay.
	- Use LibBabble-Race-3.0 for race translations.
Infus:
	- Add more support for spellIds in buff names
	SpellIds are now also supported without a full scan.
	Since this still uses UnitAura mutliple spells with the same name
	will trip up without full scans. On importing triggers with spellIds
	the spellName is reset, so that sharing auras with spellIds works
	across languages.
	
	Note: We might want to reset the spellname also if the client
	language changed, (If we can detect that.) but this patch doesn't
	do that.
	- Load option for realm
	The name by itself is not necesarily unique.
	- Add a load option for race.
	E.g. useful for racial abilities
	- Fix UnitPower triggers not working on initial log on
	E.g. for me shadow orbs, runic power and monk's energy bar would
	not correctly show up after logging in. Add the same event that is
	used by stances to trigger all UnitPower related prototypes 0.5s
	after login.
	- ModelPaths: Update to 6.0 models
	Used the file list from
	http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html
	
	and converted it via a small Qt/C++ program, source at
	http://pastebin.com/ETsvzWJm
	
	Adds tons of new models. :)
Benjamin Staneck:
	- just set the frame height to 500 when being <= 40 before when unminimizing so people can't end up stuck in mini mode anymore.
	- don't change from a generic name to a correct one for now so user configs don't reset.
Infus:
	- Fix hiding auras in rare cases
	The problematic case was reported via a wowace message thread and
	involved a Cooldown Progress Dark Soul aura in a dynamic group,
	which wouldn't hide even though the progress was done.
	See: http://pastebin.com/1KPwbrt3
	
	Collpase should also reset region.show so that a previous Expand,
	that hasn't yet happened is canceled. Do the same for Expand after
	Collapse.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Next round of indenting fixes
	- more indent fixes
	- indenting fixes
	- Simplify the rest of the secondary ressources
	- Simplify Holy Power tracking and actually use UNIT_POWER for ComboPoints
	- Whitespace cleanup
	- Tentative fix for transitioning animations, nobody understands this code, it's sad.
