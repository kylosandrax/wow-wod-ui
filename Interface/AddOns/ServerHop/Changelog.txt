**Server Hop 1.14**
Hello everyone, sorry for a slow update. I'm constantly watching your youtube reviews of my addon and really happy about it, however almost no one ever using this addon for raid/dungeon/mount searching, only for hopping (I wonder why. Also right click that favourite star!).  That's why from now on I'll be steadily reworking search engine to allow searching multiple dungeons/raids at once. I'll be releasing it as the Legion launches where, I believe, those activities'll become ultra popular. During the wait time, I'll be pushing some fixes and small features as your suggestions come to the comment section. Cheers!
